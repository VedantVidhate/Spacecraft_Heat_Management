# Project Title: Spacecraft Thermal Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and management of spacecraft thermal data to monitor and optimize heat management. The dataset and the accompanying Jupyter Notebook focus on processing, analyzing, and visualizing thermal data collected from spacecraft operations.

## Files in the Repository
- **Dummy_Dataset_For_HEAT_MANAGEMENT.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing code to process and analyze the thermal data. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and analysis techniques.
- **spacecraft_thermal_data.csv**: A CSV file containing the raw thermal data collected from spacecraft sensors. The file includes various temperature readings and relevant parameters.

## Dataset Description
The CSV file `spacecraft_thermal_data.csv` includes the following columns:
- **Time**: Timestamp of the data collection.
- **Sensor_ID**: ID of the thermal sensor.
- **Temperature_C**: Temperature recorded in Celsius.
- **Location**: The specific location of the sensor on the spacecraft.
- **Other_Parameters**: Additional parameters relevant to thermal analysis (customize based on actual data).

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Import**: Loading the thermal dataset from the CSV file.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing temperature trends over time and identifying anomalies.
4. **Modeling and Analysis**: Analyzing the data for heat management insights (e.g., detecting overheating points, temperature patterns).
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and potential recommendations for spacecraft heat management.
